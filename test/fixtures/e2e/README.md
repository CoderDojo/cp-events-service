## Description of test-data
Files not described here are used for unit testing of the Âµs
### Events
Events are created based on a loop of dojos (from 1 to x) and named based on the index as of
"test event {n}". If there is no dojo, we use the previous.
Applications are created based upon applications relationship, retrieving the dojo by name, the event by name ("test event {n}", where the event is name is specified in the applications.json) and a user email.
